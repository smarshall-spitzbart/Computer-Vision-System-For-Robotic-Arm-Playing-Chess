# Computer Vision System For Robotic Arm Playing Chess
In playing a chess game, each board position was referenced to a 3-D coordinate describing where each type of chess piece should reside on that square. Throughout a long game, pieces would tend to displace from their intended coordinates. Therefore, a need existed to continuously validate the proper positioning of pieces and correct for any position errors that arose throughout a game. My solution was to develop a computer vision system to achieve this.
